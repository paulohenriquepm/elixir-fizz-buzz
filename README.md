# FizzBuzz

This code receives an array of numbers and replace them for :fizz, :buzz or :fizz_buzz, following the rule:

- If the number is a multiple of 3, then should replace it with :fizz
- If the number is a multiple of 5, then should replace it with :buzz
- If the number is a multiple of 3 and 5, then should replace it with :fizz_buzz
